            <h2> To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty.</h2>
                <p>The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.
                    There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.
                    The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE.
                    As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.
                        I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ

                    And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé</p> 

        <h1 id ="Navy Seals">2. Navy Seals</h1>
            <h2>What the frick did you just fricking say to me you little bish?!</h2>
                <p>I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the frick out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fricking words. You think you can get away with saying that shiz to me over the Internet? Think again, fricker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fricking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable arse off the face of the continent, you little shiz. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fricking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shiz fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fricking dead, kiddo.</p>

        <h1 id ="Anyone Else">3. ANYONE ELSE???!!!</h1>
            <h2>What I love about Twitch is I just get to be myself, I do get be myself.</h2>
            <p> I get to be a very very different part of myself. It‚Äôs really interesting when people come into chat, and they accuse me of being fake. I don‚Äôt disagree with you, 
                I don‚Äôt know who my authentic self is on stream yet. Every single day that I come on here I discover new things about myself that I‚Äôm willing to share with you, and new things about myself that feel important to share with you, and, and I love sharing them with you, you guys. 
                I really really do. I surprise myself and I surprise you. I had another streamer recently say that I surprise them as well. And discovering that I have the ability to surprise even old pros at this game, really really makes me feel like I am where I‚Äôm supposed to be. 
                The, wishlistdestroyer: ‚Äúur not fake ur just crazy‚Äù! Yes! of course I‚Äôm crazy! I‚Äôm crazy in love, I‚Äôm crazy happy, I‚Äôm CRAZY high on life. I really really liked being where I am, I like the people that I‚Äôm with, and I have felt this way for my entire life. When it was in high school, when it was in elementary school, when it was in University, when it was in College. 
                When I worked at summer camp, when I worked at the hot dog factory, when I worked for hot dog factory, or when I worked as a Disney Princess. When I‚Äôm on twitch, I find people that I love, I find people that I like and I keep them close to me. The people who come back each and every day are the people that I want to see each and every day. 
                And the haters can come every day if they want to, and I‚Äôll be happy to see you too. Because at least you‚Äôre showing me that I‚Äôm important to you with your consistency. And if I can be nothing else, it is consistent! 
                Because I will come back each and every day and I will give you new reasons to hate me, and I will give you new reasons to love me. Because that‚Äôs what you deserve and that‚Äôs what I deserve. I want to see how far I can go, I want to see what I can do on this platform. I want to see how far the blanket fort can expand. I want to understand the best parts of myself. And I‚Äôm not saying that I‚Äôm gonna find them on Twitch. 
                But I think that I can find the best parts of myself. If I keep going, and I keep saying yes, and I discover the parts inside of me that I have been too afraid, too ashamed of, too apologetic! Do you realize how many times I wanna send a boy a picture of my fully exposed vulva, and the first instinct is first to apologize for even messaging him in the first place? 
                I want to say I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm bothering you, I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm messaging you, I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm texting you, I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm dm‚Äôing you, I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm talking to you, I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm caring about you, I‚Äôm sorry that I‚Äôm trying to figure out who you are, because all I want to do is open up enough dialogue so that I can expose everything about myself! 
                The only thing that I want to do is expose who I truly am to you! But I feel self-conscious because people tell me that I‚Äôm fake, and people tell me that I‚Äôm faking these things, and that I‚Äôm psychotic, that I‚Äôm ADHD, that I‚Äôm on drugs. that I‚Äôm all these terrible things, but I‚Äôm not. 
                What is actually happening is that I LOVE being here. I love being on Twitch. This has been a dream of mine for so many years, so many years that I‚Äôm embarrassed to talk about it. Can you imagine meeting a boy that you want to screw, and the first words out of your mouth are ‚ÄúAll I want to do is be a famous Twitch streamer.‚Äù He‚Äôs never heard of Twitch, he just wants to put his shlong in you, and you‚Äôre talking about Twitch. 
                Guess what motherfrickers, sometimes it works out. I SCREWED that motherfricker and he bought me this great big toy. Because I became a famous Twitch streamer! That motherfricker believed in my dream even though he had never heard of Twitch before. And each and every one of you believes in my dream. 
                Because we‚Äôre on Twitch together today and I believe we can go even further, even higher, even more into the blanket fort. And I think that we can do it together. And I don‚Äôt know that I can‚Äôt do it by myself. I can literally only do it with each and every one of you. And I think that we can. This channel has grown bigger, and faster, and more intensely than any other channel on Twitch has ever before. 
                The clips are good. Make sure the titles are sexy. Make sure that you do me good guys. Cause I come in here every single day covered in glitter, covered in sequins, covered in booty shorts, covered in nylons. So that I do not violate the terms of service, so that each and every one of you can have both hands on the keyboard, so that you can enjoy the stream, so that you can have a good time listening to me, playing with me, singing with me, smiling with me, enjoying your life. 
                Which you do, you do deserve to enjoy. Each and every moment of your life you enjoy and each and every moment of your life is worthy. You guys, you can do it. You can be the best that you can be, and we can do it together. 
                It‚Äôs gonna take effort, and it‚Äôs going to take patience, it‚Äôs going to take a lot a lot a lot of work. But if we don‚Äôt try then what the frick is stopping us from just throwing ourselves off a bridge, and giving up, and saying ‚ÄúYeah the planet is dying. The government hates us. 
                The animals are leaving. The aliens aren‚Äôt contacting us. We might be alone. It just might be you and me.‚Äù But that‚Äôs okay. Because do you really need anyone else!?</p>

                <h2>My Grandfather Smoked his whole life</h2>
                <p>I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.
                    '. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer.
                     It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.
                     " I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, 
                     because your post gave me cancer anyway.</p>

        <h1 id="Edgy Memelord Monolouge">5. Egdy Memelord Monolouge</h1>
                <h2>I don't know kid,</h2>
                <p>I don't think you have the balls to be part of our group, we're not like everyone else, we're special, we're... edgy memelords. 
                    You see, kid, you've been raised in what we like to call the "normie-sphere", where the memes are harmless, they're mere comical observations of our daily lifestyles, they take no risks. 
                    In our group we take risks everyday, our humor knows no limits, we'll make fun of everyone and everything! The Holocaust, the 9/11 attacks, Harambe... yeah, that's right, we even make jokes about that gorilla who was shot, 
                    isn't that insensitive? We don't care, though. We feel no sympathy anymore, our hearts are cold and our souls are dark, there's a void in my body that can only be filled with memes, DARK memes. You know, sometimes I wish I was normal, I wish I could laugh at these normie-tier memes, be an ordinary person for once... But I know that will never happen. My mind has been exposed to so many school shooting jokes and self-deprecation humor that I have become desensitized to plebeian entertainment. Kid, consider carefully if you really want to be one of us, 
                    there's too much at stake, once you're in you can never go back, NEVER.</p>

                <p> as in the sound made when the joke "woooshes" over your head. I bet you're too stupid to get it, IDIOT!! üò§üò§üòÇ

                    My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. ü§¨ What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.ü§≠
                    
                    In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as "R/Wooooosh" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment üòè. 
                    Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as "Schadenfreude," which means "harm-joy" üò¨üò≤. WOW! ü§™ Another reference I had to explain to you. 
                    ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§≠ I am going to cease this conversation for I do not converse with simple minded persons.üòèüòÇ</p>

                <h2>Im coming back form a 10 minute ban,</h2>
                <p>I am coming back from my 10 minute ban, and I want to say that I think it was bullshit. 
                    Yes, I wrote a funny paragraph that turned into copypasta, 
                    which happened to bring a laugh or smile to a few people. If you mods wanted that to stop, 
                    you could have just said so. 
                    Theres probably some Ego driven MOD in here and he is the one that banned me.</p>
        <h1 id="Not Funny">8. Not Funny. Didn't Laugh</h1>
                <h2>Not funny I didn't laugh. </h2>
                <p>Your joke is so bad I would have preferred the joke went over my head and you gave up re-telling me the joke. To be honest this is a horrid attempt at trying to get a laugh out of me. Not a chuckle, not a hehe, not even a subtle burst of air out of my esophagus. Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all. The amount of brain power you must have put into that joke has the potential to power every house on Earth. Get a personality and learn how to make jokes, read a book. I'm not saying this to be funny I genuinely mean it on how this is just bottom barrel embarrassment at comedy. You've single handedly killed humor and every comedic act on the planet. I'm so disappointed that society has failed as a whole in being able to teach you how to be funny. Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff. You're lucky I still have the slightest of empathy for you after telling that joke otherwise I would have committed every war crime in the book just to prevent you from attempting any humor ever again. We should put that joke in text books so future generations can be wary of becoming such an absolute comedic failure. Im disappointed, hurt, and outright offended that my precious time has been wasted in my brain understanding that joke. In the time that took I was planning on helping kids who have been orphaned, but because of that you've waisted my time explaining the obscene integrity of your terrible attempt at comedy. Now those kids are suffering without meals and there's nobody to blame but you. 
                    I hope you're happy with what you have done and I truly hope you can move on and learn from this piss poor attempt</p>
